    <h2>OTGuard</h2>
    <p>OTGuard is a tool for providing two-factor authentication with zero configuration on services that have
        single-factor authentication and do not integrate with any 2FA solution. It is not meant to be used in isolation
        but is intended to be part of a defense in depth strategy where applications listening on the ports have their
        own authentication. OTGuard aims to provide a small attack surface with only ~ 300 lines of code and uses
        privilege separation.</p>
    <p>One of the key benefits of OTGuard is that it is the only solution that works with applications that expect
        direct access to services, such as Jellyfin and Nextcloud. While it is not a replacement for Identity Aware
        Proxies or SSO, it aims to provide 2FA with zero configuration on services.</p>
    <p>OTGuard is the second factor in 2FA, and it is expected that services provide the first factor with usernames and
        passwords. The tool uses OTP codes, which makes it less vulnerable to replay attacks. All firewall rules are
        reset daily to provide some security against compromised devices. Users will need to authenticate every day, and
        this reduces the amount of code and the attack surface even further.</p>
    <p>The workflow for OTGuard is simple. Users try to access a service, and if it does not work, they log in on
        OTGuard. Once authenticated, users will have access to the desired service. The tool does not check whether the
        user is already allowed or use cookies as it seems like unnecessary complexity.</p>
    <p>OTGuard is inspired by solutions like port knocking or Fwknop but unlike port knocking, passwords are not sent in
        the clear, and unlike Fwknop, it provides OTP codes so that passwords cannot be reused.</p>
    <h3 id="disclaimer">Disclaimer</h3>
    <p>OTGuard is currently on alpha. Take your time to understand its intended use and do not use it on production
        systems for now unless you are keen to go through all the code and ensure it meets your security requirements.
    </p>
    <h3 id="install">Install</h3>
    <p>To install: download and extract the tarball. Then run the install command which will guide you through the
        installation.</p>
    <pre><code>$ wget https://github.com/cristianrz/otguard/releases/download/230324/otguard-230324.tgz
$ tar xzvf otguard-*.tgz
# ./install</code></pre>
    <p>The install process will create a certificate and a TOTP secret for you.</p>
    <h3 id="usage">Usage</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>First, store your TOTP secret in your preferred TOTP generator (I recommend KeePassXC)</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Enable the OTGuard service</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <pre><code># systemctl enable --now otguard</code></pre>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>Ensure first that your site is inaccessible from the internet.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>If you go on <code>https://your.website</code> you shouldn’t see anything.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Ensure you have firewall rules to allow traffic on port 8443 (by default) for OTGuard, for example</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <pre><code># iptables -I INPUT -p tcp -m tcp --dport 8443 -j ACCEPT </code></pre>
    <ul>
        <li>Now head onto <code>https://your.website:8443</code>:</li>
    </ul>

    </center>
    <ul>
        <li>Try to put a random user and code:</li>
    </ul>
    <center>
        <img src="https://github.com/cristianrz/otguard/raw/main/img/wrong_login.png" width="300">
    </center>
    <ul>
        <li>Put the correct TOTP:</li>
    </ul>

        <img src="https://github.com/cristianrz/otguard/raw/main/img/success.png" width="300">
    </center>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>Now if you go back to <code>https://your.website</code> you should have access to it.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>If you check <code>iptables</code> you can see what rules OTGuard created:</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <pre><code># iptables -S | grep otguard
-A INPUT -s 10.10.10.1/32 -p tcp -m tcp --dport 80 -m comment --comment otguard -j ACCEPT
-A INPUT -s 10.10.10.1/32 -p tcp -m tcp --dport 443 -m comment --comment otguard -j ACCEPT</code></pre>
    <ul>
        <li>Rules are purged daily. A cron file is installed in <code>/etc/cron.d</code> that does it. Feel free to
            amend as necessary. Rules can also be purged manually with</li>
    </ul>
    <pre><code># /usr/local/otguard/bin/otguard-purgerules</code></pre>
    <ul>
        <li>If you check again there should be no otguard rules:</li>
    </ul>
    <pre><code># iptables -S | grep otguard</code></pre>
    <h2 id="configuration">Configuration</h2>
    <p>The default install uses a self-signed certificate and a randomly generated secret.</p>
    <p>To install a new certificate you can replace <code>key.pem</code> and <code>cert.pem</code> in
        <code>/etc/otguard</code>.</p>
    <p>To add, remove or change users you can edit <code>/etc/otguard/secrets</code>. Each user should be a new line in
        the form of <code>&lt;username&gt;:&lt;secret&gt;</code>.</p>
